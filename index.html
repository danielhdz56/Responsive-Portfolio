				Purpose of this container is to set a idth of 960px, and be able to center accordingly.
				Although I was advised to set the max-width to 960px, I felt necessary to use a width instead

			Should the aside be inside the main element or outside? 
			One could argue that it should be outside because it is often used as another navigation menu. Which is not a part of the "main" content".
			However, one could also argue that it makes sense visually to break up elements inside the body in three parts:
			header, main, footer
			...When I ask in class the answer is "it depends" so it is safe to assume that "it depends"
			Note to self: Add to list of things to ponder during self-reflection time.

							This image appeared bigger than the other icons even when specifying different widths. 
							After using dev tools it was apparent that the first two icons just had whitespace around the image. 
							I handled this issue by cropping that whitespace out.
							It appears that the instructors didn't catch this (as the stackoverflow icon is still bigger in the snapshots)

						<p>Hello, I am an aspiring full-stack web developer. To meet this goal I put in 60+ hours a week, and do a lot of peer programming with other web developers. I am pretty confident using HTML, CSS, and Git. I am currently going into bootstrap and javascript.</p>
						<p>I have taught at the High School level and have been in charge of the Math Department. In my previous job I regularly worked with interpreting data and managing teams.</p>
